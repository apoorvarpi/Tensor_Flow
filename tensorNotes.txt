1)Central unit of data - tensor
 set of primitive values shaped into an array of any number of dimensions
2)Number of dimensions of a tensor - Rank of a tensor

Tensor flow consists of 2 main discrete sections
1) Building Computational Graph - series of Tensor Flow operations arranged into graph form
2) Running the Computational Graph

In order to evaluate a node, run the graph within a session.
Create a session object and invoke its function run() in order to valuate the values of
the nodes.

Complex nodes can be created by combining the already created nodes with operational nodes.
eg - 'Add' is also a node.

A graph can be parameterized to accept external inputs, known as placeholders
A placeholder is a promise to provide a value later.

To make the model trainable, we need to be able to modify the graph to get new outputs with the same
input. Variables allow us to add trainable parameters to a graph.
They are constructed with a type and initial value.

constants are initialized while calling tf.constant() and their values never change.

To initialize all the variables in a Tensor Flow program,
you must explicitly call a special operation.
